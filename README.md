# TurtleGame
It has my Turtle Game! It is a very simple game using the python library turtle. Check the README for how to use.

## How to use?
### Option 1
1.Download python using the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

2.Download the **requirements.txt** file by first typing in your console: `cd "path\to\turtle\game"`, then type: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3.Finally, type `python -m TurtleGame2.3.1.py`.

### Option 2
Double-click the .exe file Turtle Game 2.3.1.

## How to play?
Use the arrow keys, numbers 1-6, and letters: c, s, e, q, and h. 
The arrow keys turn and move the "turtle" while the numbers change the color. c makes a circle, s a square, e erases the canvas, q quits TurtleGame, and h returns the "turtle" to the middle of the screen.
